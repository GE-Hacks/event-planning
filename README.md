To begin, fire up a local server from inside the `app` directory. Please make sure to serve up the contents of the directory rather than root as routing will otherwise fail to correctly function.

## Firing up a server using Python

If you are a Windows user, install Python and from inside the `app` directory run:

```
python -m http.server 8080
```

or on a Mac/*nix machine, run:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

You can of course also use WAMP or an alternative tool for serving up content.
